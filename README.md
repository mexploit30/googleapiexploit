# Google Maps Places API Exploit PoC

This Python script, named `googleapiexploit.py`, leverages the Google Maps Places API to mass fetch restaurant data from random cities.

If you've identified a publicly exposed api key during your bug bounty hunting content discovery, you can use this script as a PoC for impact. 

Every time the api is called with the exposed key, it costs the org money. This particular function "Text-Search Places" at the time of writing is $32 / 1000 requests. Source: https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mexploit30/googleapiexploit.git

2. **Change to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd googleapiexploit

3. **Install the required dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing the required arguments:

    python3 googleapiexploit.py --api-key <vulnerable_api_key> --cities 10 --threads 5
  
  '--api-key': Google API Key from your discovery. 
  
  '--cities': Number of random cities to call.
  
  '--threads': Number of threads to use for concurrent requests (default: 5).

  By default, the script uses the "cities.txt" file that I have included. Just make sure that the file is in the directory that the script is installed. You can add cities to this list or supply your own list as long as it's renamed "cities.txt" the script should import it correctly. 

  This script is a work in progress, feel free to make suggesstions for features and updates. 

## Results

Results will print to screen with the full URL's. You can use these for PoC on your bug bounty program.
