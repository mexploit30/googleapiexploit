# Google Places API Exploit

This Python script, named `googleapiexploit.py`, leverages the Google Places API to mass fetch restaurant data from random cities.

If you've identified a publicly exposed api key during your bug bounty hunting content discovery, you can use this script as a PoC for impact. 

Every time the api is called with the exposed key, it costs the org money. This particular function "Text-Search Places" at the time of writing is $32 / 1000 requests. Source: https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/
